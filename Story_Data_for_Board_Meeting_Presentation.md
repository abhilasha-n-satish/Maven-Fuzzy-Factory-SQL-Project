# Board Meeting Presentation Insights:

## Introduction :
Maven Fuzzy Factory, an emerging star, has been on an exciting journey. In the span of just a few months, the company has not only launched successfully but has also shown remarkable progress in various aspects of its business. Here is a story that captures the essence of this journey, highlighting key insights and data-driven achievements.

## My Role:
I play the role of an e-commerce database analyst and is tasked with providing the story of companyâ€™s growth using trended performance data, quantify the revenue impacts of some of the wins and analyze the current performance and use that data available to assess the opportunities.

## Insights:
### The Rise of Gsearch: 
Gsearch has been the cornerstone of Maven Fuzzy Factory's success. The monthly trends for Gsearch sessions and orders are nothing short of phenomenal. Starting from around 60 orders in the initial month, the order volume soared to nearly 370 orders since the start.

### The Brand campaigns:
The distinction between nonbrand and brand campaigns in Gsearch has revealed an uplifting narrative. The brand component is gaining momentum, indicating Maven Fuzzy Factory's growing recognition and acceptance in the market. This aspect of growth is particularly promising, as it signifies the building of a loyal customer base and offers a compelling story for investors.

### Granular Analysis:
A deep analysis into the nonbrand Gsearch data, broken down by device type, showcased the company's analytical capabilities. The most striking finding was the significant increase in desktop orders compared to mobile. This granular analysis not only demonstrates the company's understanding of its traffic sources but also highlights the diverse preferences of its customer base.

### Channel diversification:
A comprehensive analysis of all traffic channels were conducted, as the concern revolving the over-reliance on Gsearch was growing. The findings were reassuring: all channels are showing growth, with organic and direct channels, which incur no additional marketing costs, also on an upward trend.

### Website Performance Excellence:
The company's focus on improving website performance has paid off. The session-to-order conversion rates have seen a steady increase from around 3.2%/2.6% in the initial months to significantly higher rates in the subsequent months. This improvement in conversion rates is a clear indicator of enhanced user experience and operational efficiency.

### The success of a new Lander Page:
The Gsearch lander test was an initiative that reaped substantial rewards. With a 0.0087 additional conversion rate per session for the custom lander page, the test resulted in approximately 50 extra orders per month. This outcome underscores the importance of continuous experimentation and optimization in e-commerce.

### Conversion Funnel Clarity (between 2 landing pages):
An in-depth analysis of the conversion funnel from the lander page test showed that the custom lander page outperformed the home page. This insight into the customer journey from page visits to orders highlights the effectiveness of targeted landing pages in converting visits into sales.

### Billing Page breakthrough:
The billing page test, another strategic initiative, showed a remarkable $8.51 lift per billing session. With the new billing page generating a monthly revenue impact of $10,160, this test stands as a clear indicator of the significant financial benefits that can be achieved through such optimizations.

## Conclusion:
So far,from leveraging Gsearch to refining the customer journey, each step has contributed to a story of success and growth. This is turning out to be a story of an e-commerce entity evolving into a customer-centric, and diversified online retail powerhouse.
